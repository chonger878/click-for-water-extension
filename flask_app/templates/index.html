    <h3>Water is life</h3>
    <p>One of UNICEF's Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) is about
        health and well-being.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Goal 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being 
        for all, at all ages. Health and well-being are important 
        at every stage of oneâ€™s life, starting from the beginning. 
        This goal addresses all major health priorities: 
        reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health;
        communicable and non-communicable diseases; universal health 
        coverage; and access for all to safe, effective, quality and 
        affordable medicines and vaccines.
